Version 0.9.1

The idea of this project is to toss out a sphere of energy that grows a large tree with a portal in it.
When the tree grows crawl into the portal to enter a new world. 
In this world behind you, you will find a portal back to the real world. And infront of you a harp playing proximity music.
Collect the harp and bring it home.

Have fun!
